// SuggestPatexPriorityFee returns a max priority fee value that can be used such that newly
// created transactions have a very high chance to be included in the following blocks, using a
// simplified and more predictable algorithm appropriate for chains like Patex with a single
// known block builder.
//
// In the typical case, which results whenever the last block had room for more transactions, this
// function returns a minimum suggested priority fee value. Otherwise it returns the higher of this
// minimum suggestion or 10% over the median effective priority fee from the last block.
//
// Rationale: For a chain such as Patex where there is a single block builder whose behavior is
// known, we know priority fee (as long as it is non-zero) has no impact on the probability for tx
// inclusion as long as there is capacity for it in the block. In this case then, there's no reason
// to return any value higher than some fixed minimum. Blocks typically reach capacity only under
// extreme events such as airdrops, meaning predicting whether the next block is going to be at
// capacity is difficult *except* in the case where we're already experiencing the increased demand
// from such an event. We therefore expect whether the last known block is at capacity to be one of
// the best predictors of whether the next block is likely to be at capacity. (An even better
// predictor is to look at the state of the transaction pool, but we want an algorithm that works
// even if the txpool is private or unavailable.)
//
// In the event the next block may be at capacity, the algorithm should allow for average fees to
// rise in order to reach a market price that appropriately reflects demand. We accomplish this by
// returning a suggestion that is a significant amount (10%) higher than the median effective
// priority fee from the previous block.

		// have access to the txpool, we instead adopt the following heuristic: consider a block as
		// at capacity if the total gas consumed by its transactions is within max-tx-gas-used of
		// the block limit, where max-tx-gas-used is the most gas used by any one transaction
		// within the block. This heuristic is almost perfectly accurate when transactions always
		// consume the same amount of gas, but becomes less accurate as tx gas consumption begins
		// to vary. The typical error is we assume a block is at capacity when it was not because
		// max-tx-gas-used will in most cases over-estimate the "capacity margin". But it's better
		// to err on the side of returning a higher-than-needed suggestion than a lower-than-needed
		// one in order to satisfy our desire for high chance of inclusion and rising fees under
